# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch is a simple drawing board on which you can doodle on. trying to emulate it's function through html, css and javascript for computer devices.

improvements to be made yet:
1. be able to draw after a click, instead of hovering 
2. export feature 
3. change size button to how a pop up within the window (instead of the prompt/alert message)
