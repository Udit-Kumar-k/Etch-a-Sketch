# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch is a simple drawing board on which you can doodle on. emulating it's function through html, css and javascript for computer devices is the main goal of this project

improvements to be made yet:
1. be able to draw after a click, instead of hovering 
2. export feature 
3. change size button to how a pop up within the window (instead of the prompt/alert message)
